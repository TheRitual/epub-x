### Fixed

- View selected files: Removed duplicate bottom border line so the frame has a single bottom edge.

### Changed

- HTML styled output: Extraction footer and chapter navigation (previous / TOC / next) links now use the active HTML theme. New theme classes: extraction footer link, chapter nav, chapter nav link. Links have no underline by default and underline on hover; built-in themes updated for consistent footer and nav styling.
