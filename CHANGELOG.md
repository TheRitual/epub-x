## [1.2.2](https://github.com/TheRitual/ebook-x/compare/v1.2.1...v1.2.2) (2026-02-17)

### Bug Fixes

- Correct version syntax in nfpm.yaml and improve formatting in run-extract.mjs ([d621c05](https://github.com/TheRitual/ebook-x/commit/d621c050c97683c70df9b95718e4dff9ee451780))

# Unreleased

### Fixed

- View selected files: Images column now shows Yes when any selected format (MD/HTML/JSON) has “Include images” enabled in settings (previously only the first format was considered).
- View selected files: Removed duplicate bottom border line so the frame has a single bottom edge.

### Changed

- HTML styled output: Extraction footer and chapter navigation (previous / TOC / next) links now use the active HTML theme. New theme classes: extraction footer link, chapter nav, chapter nav link. Links have no underline by default and underline on hover; built-in themes updated for consistent footer and nav styling.
